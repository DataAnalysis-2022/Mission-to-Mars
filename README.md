# Mission-to-Mars



## Background

To make the webpage looks more interesting, we will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.



### Results

1. #### Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

   We scrape the image URL and title and put it into a dictionary, as shown below:

   ![url-title](Resources/deliver-1.png)

2. #### Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

​		With the full resolution images and titles, the updated webpage looks like the following image:

​									![webpage](Resources/deliver-2.png)
